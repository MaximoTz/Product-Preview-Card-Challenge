### What I learned

I learned to use the overflow-hidden style that helps me hide all the elements that go outside the box or container (div class = "container") and thus be able to make the border radius apply to the image as well.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```HTML
<div class= "Container"> learning how to better use classes </div>
```
```CSS
.container {
    max-width: 600px; /* Maximum container size */
    width: 100%; /* Width of the container in percentage */
    margin: 150px auto; /* Center the container horizontally */
    background-color: white;
    border-radius: 15px;
    overflow: hidden; /* So that the rounded edge is applied to the image as well */
}
```

### Continuous development

I want to focus more on being able to expand my knowledge and thus improve my mobile designs while improving on other topics.
